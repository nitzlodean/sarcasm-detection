Here are some instructions on how to access our model.
- As the file sizes are too big for GitHub, we have attached links to the respective folders
  - features -> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lPoftU0Geg21L_KBpjTVt7d7M-F-qxZy?usp=sharing
  - dataset -> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y_CUhOYObrgCeUfq4N6IU-yWA9a51jXl?usp=sharing
- The features used in the models are under the ‘features’ folder, please make sure to have access to these and adjust file pathing as required in the respective models!
- Saved versions of the models are stored in the ‘models’ folder for easier and quicker access so only run the models in the notebooks if required!
- Please make sure your device can handle the runtime requirements for the code as some models may require a lot of training time due to the large amount of data!
